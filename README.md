# Coarse-Grain-Tutorial
This is a short tutorial on how to perform a peptide-membrane interaction simulation using the Martini force field, together with the Gromacs package.

# Getting started
The first step is to create our simulation box, which will have the following study system:

- Membrane simulating that of a healthy mammal: (100% POPC).
- Magainin-2 ETP

The membrane can be created directly with the free software [Charmm-gui](https://www.charmm-gui.org/), all you need to do is register. However, to save time I have moved the work forward and we will be able to download it directly from this repository at the following link:
